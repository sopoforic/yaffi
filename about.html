  This project was inspired by The Penultimate Ranma Fanfic Index (which is,
  sadly, defunct) and similar resources of yesteryear. A debt of gratitude is
  also owed to <a href="http://vffa.ficfan.org/">The Vanished FanFic Archive</a>
  which has related goals.
</p>
<p>
  A particular focus of YAFFI is older fanfiction that is less visible on
  today's internet. As such, fanfiction from fanzines will be listed even if no
  copy is available on the web.
</p>
<p>
  The RAAC archive (a copy of which can be found
  <a href="https://archives.eyrie.org/anime/">here</a>) is another major
  resource for populating this index. As an homage to Rakhal's Penultimate Ranma
  Fanfic Index, it is a goal of YAFFI to eventually index the entire Ranma
  section. Of approximately 2400 stories in the Ranma section,
  35 are currently present in the index.
</p>
<p>
  The current version of this index was last updated on 2018-02-12 and
  contains 94 fanfics (89 complete),
  totalling 1284 pages. In addition, there are
  2009 fanfics queued to be added in future updates.
