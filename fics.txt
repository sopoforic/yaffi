Title: Variation On An Unoriginal Theme
Author: Barbara Wenk
Sources: Star Trek: The Original Series
Categories: bad, romance, print
Indexed: 2018-02-09

A Vulcan woman, T'Prais, transfers aboard the Enterprise. A man, Lieutenant
Richards, becomes obsessed with her, transfers her under his command, and
generally harasses her and won't leave her alone. This is all apparently very
romantic, because the story ends with him asserting that she is going to marry
him whether she likes it or not and forcing a kiss on her which was
"apparently, perfectly acceptable".

Title: Visit to a Weird Planet
Author: Jean Lorrah, Willard F. Hunt
Sources: Star Trek: The Original Series
Characters: James T. Kirk, Spock, Leonard McCoy
Categories: print, real person fic
Indexed: 2018-02-09

A story (a 'real person fic', in part) in which Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are
somehow accidentally beamed to the (then-) present-day set of Star Trek,
filming in progress, and must pretend to be their counterparts (Shatner, Nimoy,
and Kelley) until they can be rescued.

Great literature it's not, but it's a serviceable bit of comedy. This story
would have a number of sequels by different authors.

Title: Vulcans and Emotions
Author: Devra Michele Langsam
Sources: Star Trek: The Original Series
Categories: print
Indexed: 2018-02-09

An essay in academic style (with citations in end notes!) considering whether
Vulcans experience emotions. It concludes: "It is the firm conviction of the
author that Vulcan emotions do exist, however unlike human emotions they may
be, and that these cannot be ignored in dealing with that planet's sentient
species."
