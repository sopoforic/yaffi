# YAFFI - Yet Another Fanfiction Index

This repository contains YAFFI, Yet Another Fanfiction Index. The index may be
viewed on the web at [http://yaffi.tk](http://yaffi.tk). If you wish to report
errors or omissions in the index, you may
[file an issue](https://github.com/sopoforic/yaffi/issues/new).

This project was inspired by The Penultimate Ranma Fanfic Index (which is,
sadly, defunct) and similar resources of yesteryear. A debt of gratitude is
also owed to <a href="http://vffa.ficfan.org/">The Vanished FanFic Archive</a>
which has related goals.

A particular focus of YAFFI is older fanfiction that is less visible on today's
internet. As such, some fanfiction, such as that published in fanzines, will be
listed even if no copy is available on the web.

The RAAC archive (a copy of which can be found
[here](https://archives.eyrie.org/anime/)) is another major resource for
populating this index. As an homage to Rakhal's Penultimate Ranma Fanfic Index,
it is a goal of YAFFI to eventually index the entire Ranma section. Of
approximately 2400 stories in the Ranma section, 36 are
currently present in the index.

The current version of this index was last updated on 2018-02-16 and
contains 108 fanfics (101 complete),
totalling 1760 pages. In addition, there are
2082 fanfics queued to be added in future updates.
