  This site provides a listing of some fanfiction that I've read: a summary,
  some details, and, where possible, a link to find it online. Many of the fics
  listed are quite old--from before the turn of the century, even--so a handy
  web link is not always available. Links into the Wayback Machine or elsewhere
  will be provided whenever I can find them.

  This project was inspired by The Penultimate Ranma Fanfic Index (which is,
  sadly, defunct) and similar resources of yesteryear. A debt of gratitude is
  also owed to <a href="http://vffa.ficfan.org/">The Vanished FanFic Archive</a>
  which has related goals.
